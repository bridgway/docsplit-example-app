Exhibit 3: Benchmark’s data about Safety

Asahi planned to invest 230 billion yen in expansion in 1989 and 1990. At first
glance, the proposed investment of 230 billion yen to increase capacity overwhelms
the projected operating and net profits. However, I support this decision. Below are
reasons.
1. (See Exhibit 1) The profitability of Asahi has been improved drastically. Although
projections in 1989 and 1990 go down a little bit, they’re still good indicators of a
sound company.
2. (See Exhibit 2)The current ratio and quick ratio indicate that Asahi has the ability
3/4

to pay its current liabilities by using assets and finance its operations without
having to borrow.
3. (See Exhibit 2) In 1987, the Financial Leverage (3.33) is stronger indicators of
Asahi being able to take on additional debt. This number reveals that the company
has not abused debt to finance operations.
4. (See Exhibit 3) Compared with other competitors, Shareholder’s Equity Ratio of
Asahi is reasonable, even a little bit conservative. It also means Asahi could
borrow money when it has further needs.
5. Asahi’s Finance Director, Hiroshi Okada supports the data by stating that Asahi
has undervalued assets worth approximately 700 billion yen and issued stock
which secured an additional 100 billion yen.

Recommendations to Asahi
1. Go on focusing on customers’ satisfaction.
2. Consolidate its position now through economies of scale.
3. Considering Japan is a relatively mature and strictly regulated market, Asahi

should pay more attention to overseas markets for keeping stable growth.
